To start with, you will need a `GitHub account`_ and an account on `PyPI`_. Create these before you get started on this tutorial. If you are new to Git and GitHub, you should probably spend a few minutes on some of the tutorials at the top of the page at `GitHub Help`_.

Step 1: Install Cookiecutter
----------------------------

Install cookiecutter:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install cookiecutter

We'll also need poetry so [install that too](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation):

Step 2: Generate Your Package
-----------------------------

Now it's time to generate your Python package.

Use cookiecutter, pointing it at the cookiecutter-pypackage repo:

.. code-block:: bash

    cookiecutter https://github.com/briggySmalls/cookiecutter-pypackage.git

You'll be asked to enter a bunch of values to set the package up.
If you don't know what to enter, stick with the defaults.


Step 3: Create a GitHub Repo
----------------------------

Go to your GitHub account and create a new repo named ``mypackage``, where ``mypackage`` matches the ``[project_slug]`` from your answers to running cookiecutter. This is so that Travis CI and pyup.io can find it when we get to Step 5.

You will find one folder named after the ``[project_slug]``. Move into this folder, and then setup git to use your GitHub repo and upload the code:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd mypackage
    git init .
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial skeleton."
    git remote add origin git@github.com:myusername/mypackage.git
    git push -u origin master

Where ``myusername`` and ``mypackage`` are adjusted for your username and package name.

You'll need a ssh key to push the repo. You can `Generate`_ a key or `Add`_ an existing one.

.. _`Add`: https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/

Step 4: Install Dev Requirements
--------------------------------

You should still be in the folder containing the ``pyproject.toml`` file.

Install the new project's local development requirements inside a virtual environment using pipenv:

.. code-block:: bash

    poetry install
